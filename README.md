2. Setup Cloudflared to tunnel service access.
3. Create an `.env` file in the the 'apps/portainer' folder with the required environment variables.
    - Check for `${NAME_OF_ENV_VAR?}` in the docker-compose file to see which environment variables are required.
4. Access Portainer on `http://localhost:9000`.
5. Add and configure stacks in Portainer, for the services you want to host.
