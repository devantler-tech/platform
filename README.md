## Getting Started

To run the Homelab you must:

1. Create and configure a domain on Cloudflare.
2. Set up Cloudflare to tunnel service access.
3. Run the `scripts/provision.sh` script to set up a development and production cluster.
    - The development cluster is accessible on `x.test` (requires `/etc/hosts` configuration).
    - The production cluster is accessible on `x.devantler.com`. If you want to use a different domain, you must update the domains in the `patches` folders.
