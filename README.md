# My HomeLab!

Welcome to Devantler's Homelab ðŸš€

This Homelab is a single-server setup, that focuses on ease-of-use over production-capabilities. As such, it works well for hobby projects, and small-scale hosting.

## Overview

### Data Management

- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org): A popular SQL Database.
- [DataHub](https://datahubproject.io): A versatile metadata platform.
- [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org): A distributed event streaming platform.

### Apps

### Monitoring

- [Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma): An uptime monitor for self-hosted or external services.
- [Glances](https://nicolargo.github.io/glances/): Real-time system monitoring tool. (restricted to docker-allocated resources)

## Getting Started

To run the Homelab you must:

1. Create and configure a domain on Cloudflare.
2. Create an `.env` file in the the 'apps/portainer' folder with the required environment variables. 
    - Check for `${NAME_OF_ENV_VAR?}` in the docker-compose file to see which environment variables are required.
3. Access Portainer on `http://localhost:9000`.
4. Add and configure stacks in Portainer, for the services you want to host.
