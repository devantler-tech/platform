# Implementation Plan: DevantlerTech Platform

**Branch**: `001-devantlertech-platform` | **Date**: 2025-09-22 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-devantlertech-platform/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```txt
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Primary requirement: Implement GitOps configuration and infrastructure for DevantlerTech's Kubernetes platform that enables automated, declarative management through version-controlled manifests with proper security, monitoring, and local development workflows using KSail.

Technical approach: Leverage existing Flux GitOps foundation with enhanced local development tooling, implementing comprehensive SOPS encryption for secrets, Kustomize-based configuration hierarchy, and KSail-driven local validation workflows that eliminate need for cloud environment access during development.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: YAML manifests, Bash scripts, Helm Charts v3.x
**Primary Dependencies**: Flux GitOps v2.x, Cilium CNI, Traefik Ingress, SOPS+Age encryption, Kyverno policies
**Storage**: Git repository for manifests, OCI artifacts for Flux distribution, encrypted secrets via SOPS
**Testing**: KSail local cluster validation, Flux reconciliation testing, Kustomize build validation
**Target Platform**: Kubernetes 1.33+ (Kind local clusters via KSail)
**Project Type**: Infrastructure (GitOps platform configuration)
**Performance Goals**: GitOps reconciliation within 5 minutes, cluster bootstrap under 10 minutes via KSail
**Constraints**: Local-only development using KSail, no access to dev/stage/prod cloud environments, SOPS encryption mandatory
**Scale/Scope**: Single GitOps platform supporting local development workflows, extensible configuration hierarchy

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**I. GitOps-First Architecture**: ✓ All changes declared as Kubernetes YAML manifests, Flux GitOps reconciliation
**II. Security by Design**: ✓ All secrets encrypted with SOPS+Age, no plaintext secrets in repository
**III. Test-First Development**: ✓ Local KSail validation planned before any environment deployment
**IV. Infrastructure as Code**: ✓ Uses declarative YAML, Kustomize overlays, follows bases→distributions→clusters hierarchy
**V. Observability & Automation**: ✓ Monitoring, policy enforcement (Kyverno), and automation requirements addressed

```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```txt
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate GitOps infrastructure tasks from contracts and data model
- Each contract → validation test task [P] (KSail bootstrap, secret management, Flux reconciliation)
- Configuration hierarchy → Kustomize overlay tasks [P] (bases, distributions, clusters)
- Secret management → SOPS encryption setup tasks
- Platform components → Helm chart/manifest deployment tasks
- Monitoring → observability setup tasks

**Infrastructure-Specific Ordering**:

- TDD order: Tests before configuration deployment
- Dependency order: Base configs → Distribution overlays → Cluster-specific
- Bootstrap order: KSail cluster → Flux controllers → Infrastructure → Applications
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent Kustomizations)

**Task Categories**:

- Setup: KSail cluster, Age keys, SOPS configuration
- Infrastructure Tests: Contract validation, reconciliation tests
- Base Configurations: Shared infrastructure components
- Environment Overlays: Local/dev/prod specific configs
- Validation: End-to-end GitOps workflow testing

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
