## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

Platform operators and developers need a reliable, automated GitOps infrastructure that manages the DevantlerTech Kubernetes platform declaratively through version-controlled configuration files, enabling consistent deployments across multiple environments with proper security, monitoring, and rollback capabilities.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new application deployment manifest is committed to the repository, **When** the GitOps system detects the change, **Then** the application is automatically deployed to the target environment within 5 minutes
2. **Given** a configuration change is made to infrastructure components, **When** the change is merged to the main branch, **Then** the infrastructure is updated automatically with zero manual intervention
3. **Given** a deployment fails due to invalid configuration, **When** the GitOps system detects the failure, **Then** the system automatically rolls back to the previous known-good state and alerts operators
4. **Given** multiple environments (local, dev, prod) exist, **When** configuration changes are promoted through environments, **Then** each environment receives appropriate configuration overlays without manual modification
5. **Given** secrets need to be managed securely, **When** secret data is stored in the repository, **Then** all sensitive data is encrypted at rest and properly decrypted during deployment

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the GitOps reconciliation process encounters conflicting manual changes made directly to the cluster?
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues between the GitOps controller and external dependencies?
- What occurs when encrypted secrets cannot be decrypted due to missing or rotated encryption keys?
- How does the system respond when resource quotas are exceeded during deployment attempts?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically detect and reconcile configuration changes from the Git repository within 5 minutes of commit
- **FR-002**: System MUST support multi-environment deployments with environment-specific configuration overlays (local, dev, prod)
- **FR-003**: System MUST encrypt all secrets at rest using industry-standard encryption before storing in version control
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide automated rollback capabilities when deployments fail validation or health checks
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain audit logs of all configuration changes and deployment events
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate all configuration manifests before applying changes to prevent invalid deployments
- **FR-007**: System MUST support declarative infrastructure management through version-controlled manifests
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide observability and monitoring for GitOps reconciliation processes
- **FR-009**: Platform operators MUST be able to view deployment status and history through monitoring dashboards
- **FR-010**: Developers MUST be able to deploy applications by committing properly formatted manifests to designated repository paths
- **FR-011**: System MUST support both application deployments and infrastructure component management through the same GitOps workflow
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide automated certificate management and renewal for secure communications
- **FR-013**: System MUST implement policy enforcement to ensure deployed resources comply with security and governance requirements

### Key Entities

- **GitOps Controller**: Manages the reconciliation loop between Git repository state and cluster state, handling detection of changes and orchestrating deployments
- **Configuration Repository**: Version-controlled storage containing all cluster and application manifests, organized by environment and component type
- **Environment Overlay**: Environment-specific configuration modifications applied on top of base configurations to support multi-environment deployments
- **Encrypted Secret**: Sensitive configuration data that is encrypted at rest in the repository and decrypted during deployment
- **Deployment Manifest**: Declarative specification of desired application or infrastructure state in Kubernetes-native formats
- **Reconciliation Event**: Record of GitOps controller actions including success/failure status, timing, and affected resources
- **Policy Rule**: Governance constraint that validates deployments against security, resource, and compliance requirements
